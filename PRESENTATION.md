## History
Rotor machines were electro-mechanical stream ciphers that were in widespread use during the 20th century.
They consist of a number of rotors which implement a letter substitution scheme that changes when the rotors turn.
This allows the user to create a complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which makes decryption methods like frequency analysis much more difficult.

## How Our Demo Works
We show how the rotors turn and the states that they are in. We use numbers to represent the substitution shifts that are applied to each letter every step of the way, which makes it easier to see how each rotor transforms the letters.

We present a number of example wirings, with different substitutions (shifts), turn speeds, and number of rotors.
