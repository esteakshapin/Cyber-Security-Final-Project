## History
Rotor machines were electro-mechanical stream ciphers that were in widespread use during the 20th century.
They consist of a number of rotors which implement a letter substitution scheme that changes when the rotors turn.
This allows the user to create a complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which makes decryption methods like frequency analysis much more difficult.

## How Our Demo Works
We show how the rotors turn and the states that they are in. We use numbers to represent the substitution shifts that are applied to each letter every step of the way, which makes it easier to see how each rotor transforms the letters.

We present a number of example wirings, with different substitutions (shifts), turn speeds, and number of rotors.


## Early Rotor Machines
### Theo van Hengel and Rudolf Spengler (1915)
* Made a prototype
* Rejected by Dutch navy

### Hebern Rotor Machine (1917)
![](https://computerhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hebern-rotor-machine-Hebern-copy.jpg)
* Made by Edward Hebern
* Eventually had up to 5 rotors
* Rotor had to be taken out and reversed to decipher

### Enigma Machine (1918)

* Made by Arthur Scherbius
* Eventually added a plugboard
* Reflector for easier decryption, also made cipher vulnerable

### Hugo Cipher Patent (1919)
![](https://ciphermachines.com/pictures/rotor07.png)
* Made by Hugo Alexander Koch
* Never sold any cipher machines
* Sold the rights to Arthur Scherbius

### Damm Cipher Machines (1919)
![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Damm-prototype.jpg)
* Made by Arvid Damm
* Double rotor
* Irregular stepping, instead of odometer style stepping of the other rotors where only one gear moves for 26 turns
* Was used by Boris Hagelin to develop highly used cipher machines
