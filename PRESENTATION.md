## History
Rotor machines were electro-mechanical stream ciphers that were in widespread use during the 20th century.
They consist of a number of rotors which implement a letter substitution scheme that changes when the rotors turn.
This allows the user to create a complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher, which makes decryption methods like frequency analysis much more difficult.
